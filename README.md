"In this turn-based simulation game you control a small armada of spaceships. As you mine the rare mineral “kore” from the depths of space, you teleport it back to your homeworld. But it turns out you aren’t the only civilization with this goal. In each game two players will compete to collect the most kore from the board. Whoever has the largest kore cache by the end of 400 turns—or eliminates all of their opponents from the board before that—will be the winner!"
